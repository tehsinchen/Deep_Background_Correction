# deep_background_correction
The demonstration of real-time background removal with U-net

This work is the side project of this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsphotonics.0c01648 and was inspired by this paper: https://www.pnas.org/content/117/1/60

The goal of this work was to use deep learning to collect high-quality experimental data. The studies of nano-objects under scattering microscopy normally are contaminated by the background scattering resulting in making objects vague or even invisible. This demonstration provides an concept that as long as people can teach machine what background is, it is able to help people collect the data more efficiently in real-time so that the smaller but higher quality data for statistical analysis can save some effort.

This video provides the real-time results of raw and background corrected images with the same places in the sample
